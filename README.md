Hi, I'm Christian Munley, a senior undergraduate applied physics and computer science major at the University of Delaware, passionate about many things.

I am interested in the intersection of physics and computer science applied to the many interesting aspects of this world. Currently, I am exploring the application of machine learning in biophysics with the Lyman Group to gain insignts in transmembrane protein surface chemistry. structure, and more. I am also currently exploring the use of large-language models for parallel code generation (OpenMP, OpenACC) for compiler validation with the Computational Research and Programming Lab. I contribute to UD IT StudyAiDE proejct as well, implementing generative AI into UD to provide better education resources.

I think that the explosion of technology is underutilized in many domains of science, and that the integration of software engineering with scientific discovery will lead to many developments in society.

I hope to contribute of this technological scientific advancement through my research, from personal projects to group projects within academia, and through a PhD program.

Please feel free to reach out to me to chat, to collaborate on projects, or anything else.
