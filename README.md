Hi, I'm Christian Munley, a senior undergraduate applied physics and computer science major at the University of Delaware, passionate about many things.

I am interested in the intersection of physics and computer science applied to the many interesting aspects of this world. Currently, I am exploring the application of machine learning in biophysics with the Lyman Group to gain insignts in transmembrane protein surface chemistry. structure, and more. I am also currently exploring the use of large-language models for parallel code generation (OpenMP, OpenACC) for compiler validation with the Computational Research and Programming Lab. I contribute to UD IT StudyAiDE proejct as well, implementing generative AI into UD's LMS to provide educational resources for students.
Please feel free to reach out to me to chat, to collaborate on projects, or anything else.
