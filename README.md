Hi, I'm Christian Munley, a senior undergraduate applied physics and computer science major at the University of Delaware.

I am interested in the intersection of physics and computer science applied to the many interesting aspects of this world. Currently, I am exploring the application of machine learning in biophysics with the Lyman Group to learn about transmembrane protein surface chemistry. I am also exploring the use of large-language models for code generation with the Computational Research and Programming Lab. I also enjoy research in high-performance computing, such as parallel programming and benchmarking supercomputers.

I think that the explosion of technology is underutilized in many domains of science, and that the integration of software engineering with scientific discovery will lead to many developments in society.

I hope to contribute of this technological scientific advancement through my research, from personal projects to group projects within academia, and through a PhD program.

Please feel free to reach out to me to chat, to collaborate on projects, or anything else.
